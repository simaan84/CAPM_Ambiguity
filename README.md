## Overview

The analysis in the paper is supported by two main R scripts:

- `size_portfolio_sorts.R`: Replicates the empirical results from **Section 2** of the paper, which reexamines the traditional size factor.
- `main_simulation_analysis.R`: Replicates the **main simulation design** described in the paper.

The research is conducted using publicly available data sources, one of which is CRSP (licensed data), which cannot be redistributed. Nonetheless, the tickers, simulated returns, and the full baseline simulation results can be downloaded from this shared Google folder:
